                Your friend is building his sculpture by stacking wooden blocks on a beam, like those in the picture above.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    	Your job is to tell him whether you think that the sculpture in the diagram he
                shows you will stay balanced, or whether it will tip to the left or to the right.
            </p>

		<p>
			He has built three sculptures already, so you will get to make your predictions about those and then see how those fall
			(if it does not move, then it is balanced).
