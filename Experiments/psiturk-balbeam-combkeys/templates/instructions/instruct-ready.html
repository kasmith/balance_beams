            To fully use his creativity, your friend has decided that sometimes he will
            mix the materials, shapes, and position and size of the balancing strut. So
            the sculptures you see can be a mix of all of the features you have learned about.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can tell him what you think using your keyboard: you can press the <b>'c'</b> key
            if you think it will fall to the <i>left</i>, the <b>'b'</b> key if you think it will <i>balance</i>,
            and the <b>'m'</b> key if you think it will fall to the <i>right</i>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Your friend has actually made six models and filmed what happened to them,
            so you can start by making judgments about those sculptures and see if they are
            actually stable. But after that you will need to make your balance judgments
            based on pictures without seeing what happens to the sculptures.
