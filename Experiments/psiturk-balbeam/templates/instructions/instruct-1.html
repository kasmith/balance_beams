		    Your friend is a sculptor who is trying to design a new piece of work 
                    that involves balancing blocks of wood on a board above a pivot. 
                    Unfortunately, your friend is also very bad at judging whether things are balanced.
        </p>

        <p>
        	He has asked you to take a look at some of his computer-made designs and tell him whether you 
                think his designs are stable.
