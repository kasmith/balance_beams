                Your friend is building his sculpture by stacking wooden blocks similar to the ones
                in the above diagram on a beam like the one you see in the background. 
                However, the blocks may be different sizes than the ones you see in the picture.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    	Your job is to tell him whether you think that the sculpture in the diagram he 
                shows you will stay balanced, or whether it will tip to the left or to the right.
        </p>
