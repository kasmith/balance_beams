           You have now gotten through all of the sculptures your friend has built
           and filmed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Next you will be asked to make judgments about 128 sculptures that your 
            friend has designed but has not built, so you will no longer
            see what actually happens to the sculpture.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Be aware - the sculptures you have already seen are ones where it is
            more obvious what will happen to the sculptures. The ones you will
            see next may be more difficult to judge.
