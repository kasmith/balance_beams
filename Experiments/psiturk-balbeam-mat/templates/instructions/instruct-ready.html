            You can tell him what you think using buttons that will appear below the diagram.
            Once you have let him know your thoughts on one of the sculptures, he will 
            show you the next one.

            Your friend has actually made six models and filmed what happened to them,
            so you can start by making judgments about those sculptures and see if they are
            actually stable. But after that you will need to make your balance judgments
            based on pictures without seeing what happens to the sculptures.
